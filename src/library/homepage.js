My name's Sean Warman and I've been a developer since 2018. 
Here's some tips and tricks I've learned, partly so I
don't forget them myself.

Each post is kept as a markdown file in a folder on my computer
and then built using webpack and deployed automatically as I
save any file in the project.

I like the idea of keeping a database of sorts that exists as
a folder of files on an s3 bucket rather than as obfuscated 
binary code on a server.

I've made a controller that will read the folder, list all the
items in it and render them in the section on the 
right, it also makes a uri for each one.
